## Hooks for developers

#### itw_extensions
Maybe you want to support also less famous JPEG extension like jpe, jfif or jif

`add_filter( 'itw_extensions', 'extra_itw_extensions', 10, 1 );
function extra_itw_extensions( $extensions ){
	$extensions[] = 'jpe';
	$extensions[] = 'jfif';
	$extensions[] = 'jif';
	return $extensions;
}`

#### itw_sizes
Maybe you want to disable WebP for thumbnails

`add_filter( 'itw_sizes', 'disable_itw_sizes', 10, 2 );
function disable_itw_sizes( $sizes, $attachmentId ){
	unset( $sizes['thumbnail'] );
	return $sizes;
}`

#### itw_htaccess
Maybe you want to modify htaccess rules somehow

`add_filter( 'itw_htaccess', 'modify_itw_htaccess', 10, 2 );
function modify_itw_htaccess( $rewrite_rules ){
	// do some magic here
	return $rewrite_rules;
}`

#### iwt_disabled_folders
Maybe you want to disable/enable some other folders for bulk convert

`add_filter( 'iwt_disabled_folders', 'modify_iwt_disabled_folders', 10, 1 );
function modify_iwt_disabled_folders( $disabled ){
	// do some magic here
	return $disabled;
}`

#### $images_to_webp->convert_image()
Maybe you want to automatically generate WebP for other plugins

`add_action( 'XXPLUGIN_image_created', 'XX_images_to_webp', 10, 2 );
function XX_images_to_webp( $image_path ){
	global $images_to_webp;
	$images_to_webp->convert_image( $image_path );
}`


== Installation ==

1. Upload `images-to-webp` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Plugin requirements =

It should work almost everywhere ;)
PHP 5.6 or higher
GD or Imagick extension with WebP support
Enabled serve modules: `mod_mime`, `mod_rewrite`

= WebP images stored location =

WebP images are generated in same directory as original image. Example:
original img: `/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/car.png`
webp version: `/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/car.png.webp`

= How to check if plugin works? =

When you have installed plugin and converted all images, follow these steps:

1. Run `Google Chrome` and enable `Dev Tools` (F12).
2. Go to the `Network` tab click on `Disable cache` and select filtering for `Img` *(Images)*.
3. Refresh your website page.
4. Check list of loaded images. Note `Type` column.
5. If value of `webp` is there, then everything works fine.

= Apache .htaccess =

Plugin should automatically update your .htaccess with needed rules.
In case it's not possible to write them automatically, screen with instructions will appear.
Anyway, here is how it should look like:

`<IfModule mod_mime.c>
	AddType image/webp .webp
</IfModule>

<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
	RewriteEngine On
	RewriteCond %{HTTP_ACCEPT} image/webp
	RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} "/wp-content/"
	RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} "\.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif)$"
	RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME}\.webp -f
	RewriteRule ^(.+)$ $1\.webp [NC,T=image/webp,E=webp,L]
</IfModule>`

= NGiNX config =

After you activate plugin, screen with instructions will appear.
Anyway, here is how it should look like:

You need to add this map directive to your http config, usually nginx.conf ( inside of the http{} section ):

`map $http_accept $webp_suffix{
	default "";
	"~*webp" ".webp";
}`

then you need to add this to your server block, usually site.conf or /nginx/sites-enabled/default ( inside of the server{} section ):

`location ~* ^/wp-content/.+\.(png|gif|jpe?g)$ {
	add_header Vary Accept;
	try_files $uri$webp_suffix $uri =404;
}`

= ISP Manager =

Are you using ISP Manager? Then it's probably not working for you, but no worries, you just need to go to `WWW domains` and delete `jpg|jpeg|png` from the `Static content extensions` field.
